## Building BridgeIt for growth

BridgeIt is an early access product and we're actively iterating with feedback from all of you!

## What did we do?

We‚Äôre working on spreading the word about BridgeIt so that we can see how people engage.

## Social Media accounts

We previously created our [Discord](https://discord.gg/drPR7dv5vS) and [blog](https://blog.spacebarlabs.com).

* Now we‚Äôre on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61572416627190), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/spacebarlabs), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@bridgeit), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/bridgeit), and [Twitter](https://x.com/bridgeit_sbl)
    * All have logos and a profile picture
    * Blog posts automatically get posted to the new social media channels
    * If you haven‚Äôt already, please follow your favorite platform
    * We appreciate whatever you can do to help spread the word!  Social media has been one of our better ways of reaching users so far, so help is very appreciated.
* We have the start of a new referral code system.  Referral codes are internal-only right now.  Primarily, we‚Äôre trying to see what works and what doesn‚Äôt.  How do people like to sign up?  How can we help them do that better?  You‚Äôll see this on some marketing materials and the sign up form.  
* We would love to have you refer your friends to BridgeIt! During our alpha and beta testing periods, BridgeIt is free. Someday, it will be a paid service. We're considering a referral program. If you're interested in being a part of it someday, please let us know at <a href="mailto:referral@spacebarlabs.com">referral@spacebarlabs.com</a>. We appreciate your support!

* We made a new ‚ÄúBridgeIt Phrase Book‚Äù zine.  It has some useful phrases for the top 6 languages being learned in the United States, along with information on how to practice with BridgeIt.  If you would like, you can [download it](/assets/2025-02-14/BridgeIt-Phrase-Book-Zine-Rev-1.pdf), print it, and leave it in appropriate locations.  For example, little free libraries and meetups.  We suggest doing at least one test print before making multiple copies.
* We‚Äôve added more information about BridgeIt to the landing page
* We‚Äôve made it easier to sign up by making our phone number field more forgiving with regards to formatting.  It also prevents mistakes such as area codes that do not exist.
* We‚Äôve also made the phone number easier to read. <a href="sms:+18568807734?body=üëã">Text (856) 880-7734</a> is a lot nicer than +18658807734, isn't it?
* We‚Äôve found that many people like engaging via text.  Now that we‚Äôre leaving BridgeIt‚Äôs phone number out in the wild, we‚Äôve added a basic response for phone calls so that users know to text instead: "Hi! I can't take your call right now. Please send me a text message. Thanks!"

## Keeping users engaged
* We‚Äôve added a new ‚Äúnudge‚Äù feature for users who have gone dormant for at least 3 days.  To help keep users aware of their previous language practice, we send a simple wave emoji as a gentle reminder of the conversation thread.

## Known issues
* BridgeIt only supports ‚Äú+1‚Äù phone numbers (USA, Canada, etc).  This is now listed on our sign up form.  We hope to improve this situation, as we had a Spanish phone number attempt to sign up.

## Technical Improvements
* BridgeIt now stays awake all day, rather than taking naps between chunks of requests.  In some circumstances, BridgeIt might not have responded prior to this change.  We‚Äôre sorry if that affected you!
* We‚Äôve added background jobs so that some requests are less likely to bog down the server.  In addition, background jobs make it so that we can work on new types of features that were not possible before, like nudges.  It also makes some errors less likely to impact users, such as when signing up.
* Dependency updates
* Stuff for us to make it easier to test
