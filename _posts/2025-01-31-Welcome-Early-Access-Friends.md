# The BridgeIt Early Access Alpha is Here!

Hello Bridge Builders! We're excited to announce that the [BridgeIt Early Access Alpha](https://apps.spacebarlabs.com) is now available!

This completes 2 weeks of work on BridgeIt. We've been working hard to get this out to you and we're excited to see what you think.

## What's new in BridgeIt's world?

### Landing Page Content Improvements

A warm welcome matters to us. Our old landing page needed attention. Over the last 2 weeks, we have made it easier to understand what BridgeIt is and to how to get started by having a conversation with BridgeIt.  We've also started promoting BridgeIt on our main website, [Spacebar Labs](https://spacebarlabs.com).  After weeks of waiting, we finally have a vanity phone number!  You can now text "Hello" to [1-856-880-7734](sms:+18568807734) (upside down: HELLO BB GSB "Hello BB, Go Speak Better") to start a conversation with BridgeIt.

We also have a new welcome page with instructions on how to get started, complete with easy texting via buttons and QR codes.  We also have clarification on which languages BridgeIt supports (namely, pretty much all of them) with country flags.  There is also instruction on how to type in a language that uses a different script than English.

### Streamlined Sign Up Process

Our sign-up process is no longer barebones. You can now start sign up by texting a phone number.  It's also been internally reorganized to allow us to manage features such as Terms, Policy, and SMS consent and post-signup welcome texts.

### Introduction of Referral Codes

To make sharing easier, we've introduced very basic referral codes. Referrals are a great way to get your friends involved in the language learning process. We're excited to see how you use them! We have also added a progress bar to help you track our progress towards our goal of 1000 users.  We very much appreciate your help in getting there!

### Message Memory

BridgeIt now has a memory!  Previously, it only responded to the most recent message.  This resulted in having the memory of a proverbial goldfish.  Now, BridgeIt can remember previous messages.  This is a big step forward in making BridgeIt more conversational.

### Safety Improvements

BridgeIt has a number of improvements to its operating instructions that make it more safe and SMS-friendly.  We will continue to fine tune these prompts as time goes on.

### Technical Details

Like all good software companies, we update our dependencies regularly.  We also clean up unused code regularly.  We also are continuing to build out test coverage so that we can be more confident in how BridgeIt behaves.

## What does it look like?

Here are some screenshots of the new BridgeIt:
